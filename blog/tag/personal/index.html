                <p>There was a lot of brouhaha a few weeks ago about practical privacy on the
Internet. One app in particular targeted a single gender to tie together a
couple social networks to create what can only be called a stalker’s best
friend.</p>

<p>The predictable lines were drawn. “People should value their privacy more.”
“The app and the social networks have an obligation to protect our privacy.”
“They can’t protect you from yourselves.” “Their privacy settings are
deliberately difficult to use.” The two sides have formed their arguments to
their opinion.</p>

<p>I’m not joining either side. That’s a losing battle. I do believe that most
people need to take their privacy more seriously, and not just because of the
Internet, though it does mean more now than ever.</p>

<p>A long time ago, before Facebook, before smartphones, in the early days of
Internet ubiquity, I had a friend. This friend introduced me to an acquaintance
of his. I trusted this friend. I told this friend a lot of personal information
about my relationships and finances, since we lived together our finances
affected each other.</p>

<p>Unbeknownst to me, my friend repeated these private things to the acquaintance.
The acquaintance then used this information to build trust. The acquaintance
then used that trust to steal thousands of dollars from me. Which led to a
terrible spiral down into the worst part of my life.</p>

<p>Who is to blame? My friend, for violating my privacy? The acquaintance, for
building trust in order to abuse it? Myself, for trusting either of them?</p>

<p>If it’s not my fault, must I change my behavior to prevent this in the future?</p>

<p>Well, obviously.</p>

<p>But, now that I’ve been burned, should I not trust anyone?</p>

<p>Should I not use Facebook because apps like “Girls Around Me” are possible? Or
should I decide for myself how much of my privacy is worth keeping?</p>

<p>Do I believe that we need to teach people more about this “Privacy in the
Social Internet” thing? Absolutely. Do I think people are idiots for not
knowing about these things? Maybe. The psychology of it all can’t fit in the
scope of this tiny blog post.</p>

<p>Is the blame 100% on any one party? No. We all need to guard our own privacy,
and we all need to consider what our products do to our users’ privacy. </p>

<p>This social problem needs to be fixed by all of society.</p>

                <p>A long time ago, I used to blog about my feelings.</p>

<p>Obviously, since I’m a dude, I’m not supposed to have feelings. At least, I am
not supposed to have the feelings I confessed to having. At least, I am not
supposed to have those feelings if I am in sound mind.</p>

<p>I still have those posts from Livejournal or from my personal sites. I don’t
look at them anymore, but they’re there if I ever want to retread the mental
pathways of memory.</p>

<p>A long time ago, I used to talk about my feelings.</p>

<p>The blog was the beginning, or the middle, or the end, but it was part of the
self-examination. The blog was just one way to explore and exhume and explain
and examine my feelings about my life thus far.</p>

<p>A long time ago, I used to care about my feelings.</p>

<p>They were bad feelings. They were narcissistic, self-centered, obtuse, and even
hurtful. I used them, or they used me, to inflict pain on other people. I do
not mention this to ask for forgiveness; I think I need the guilt. I mention
this informationally, casually, with that detached air I have carefully
cultivated.</p>

<p>I became afraid of feeling, over time. My anger had gotten the best of me a few
times, and my fists were raised, extended, retracted, lowered. My words, a more
elegant and effective weapon, were used more often.</p>

<p>Over time, the people went away, some driven and some drifted, but no new
people came to replace them. I’ve become withdrawn, sheltered. I don’t talk a
lot, and when I do I always say the wrong things.</p>

<p>I think it’s time to feel again.</p>

<p>I think it’s time to get over my fear of feelings.</p>

                <p><a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2014/04/03/brendan-eich-steps-down-as-mozilla-ceo/">What happened to Brendan Eich at Mozilla (resigning over community uproar for
his continued support of Prop
8)</a>
has now happened to one of Github's founders. <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2014/04/21/farewell-github-hello-immersive-computing.html">Tom Preston-Werner has resigned
due to community uproar over gender-based
harassment</a>.</p>

<p>Some are decrying this as an infringement on free speech. That people should be
do and say with impunity anything that is not illegal. That all people should
not criticize or judge anyone who is not doing something illegal, as though the
law is the only true measurement of good and evil.</p>

<p>Of course, this rule does not seem to apply to the person making the
allegations, whom the mob may criticize and judge as much as they want.</p>

<p>I agree with those who feel that this is free speech working as it is intended.
No criminal charges or lawsuits have been filed (yet). Indeed, no rights for
any of the involved parties have been legally threatened. They are all
perfectly able to go about their daily lives, thriving, even in the same
industry they rose to prominence in.</p>

<p>Everyone can go around spewing all the speech they want. This is exactly as it
should be. Mozilla and Github were not required to do anything, just as we are
not required to purchase their products for any reason we choose.</p>

<p>It's interesting that people outside the tech industry are now involved in the
tech industry's gender relations struggle. It's disheartening that they seem to
support the status quo.</p>
