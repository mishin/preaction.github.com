            <p>There was a lot of brouhaha a few weeks ago about practical privacy on the
Internet. One app in particular targeted a single gender to tie together a
couple social networks to create what can only be called a stalker’s best
friend.</p>

<p>The predictable lines were drawn. “People should value their privacy more.”
“The app and the social networks have an obligation to protect our privacy.”
“They can’t protect you from yourselves.” “Their privacy settings are
deliberately difficult to use.” The two sides have formed their arguments to
their opinion.</p>

<p>I’m not joining either side. That’s a losing battle. I do believe that most
people need to take their privacy more seriously, and not just because of the
Internet, though it does mean more now than ever.</p>

<p>A long time ago, before Facebook, before smartphones, in the early days of
Internet ubiquity, I had a friend. This friend introduced me to an acquaintance
of his. I trusted this friend. I told this friend a lot of personal information
about my relationships and finances, since we lived together our finances
affected each other.</p>

<p>Unbeknownst to me, my friend repeated these private things to the acquaintance.
The acquaintance then used this information to build trust. The acquaintance
then used that trust to steal thousands of dollars from me. Which led to a
terrible spiral down into the worst part of my life.</p>

<p>Who is to blame? My friend, for violating my privacy? The acquaintance, for
building trust in order to abuse it? Myself, for trusting either of them?</p>

<p>If it’s not my fault, must I change my behavior to prevent this in the future?</p>

<p>Well, obviously.</p>

<p>But, now that I’ve been burned, should I not trust anyone?</p>

<p>Should I not use Facebook because apps like “Girls Around Me” are possible? Or
should I decide for myself how much of my privacy is worth keeping?</p>

<p>Do I believe that we need to teach people more about this “Privacy in the
Social Internet” thing? Absolutely. Do I think people are idiots for not
knowing about these things? Maybe. The psychology of it all can’t fit in the
scope of this tiny blog post.</p>

<p>Is the blame 100% on any one party? No. We all need to guard our own privacy,
and we all need to consider what our products do to our users’ privacy. </p>

<p>This social problem needs to be fixed by all of society.</p>
