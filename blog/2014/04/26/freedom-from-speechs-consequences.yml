title: Freedom From Speech's Consequences
---
[What happened to Brendan Eich at Mozilla (resigning over community uproar for
his continued support of Prop
8)](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2014/04/03/brendan-eich-steps-down-as-mozilla-ceo/)
has now happened to one of Github's founders. [Tom Preston-Werner has resigned
due to community uproar over gender-based
harassment](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2014/04/21/farewell-github-hello-immersive-computing.html).

Some are decrying this as an infringement on free speech. That people should be
do and say with impunity anything that is not illegal. That all people should
not criticize or judge anyone who is not doing something illegal, as though the
law is the only true measurement of good and evil.

Of course, this rule does not seem to apply to the person making the
allegations, whom the mob may criticize and judge as much as they want.

I agree with those who feel that this is free speech working as it is intended.
No criminal charges or lawsuits have been filed (yet). Indeed, no rights for
any of the involved parties have been legally threatened. They are all
perfectly able to go about their daily lives, thriving, even in the same
industry they rose to prominence in.

Everyone can go around spewing all the speech they want. This is exactly as it
should be. Mozilla and Github were not required to do anything, just as we are
not required to purchase their products for any reason we choose.

It's interesting that people outside the tech industry are now involved in the
tech industry's gender relations struggle. It's disheartening that they seem to
support the status quo.
