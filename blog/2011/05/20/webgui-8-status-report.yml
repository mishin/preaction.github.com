A major milestone in WebGUI 8 development was reached this week: A dry-run of
the WebGUI 8 upgrade was successfully run against the plainblack.com database.
This means the only thing remaining from releasing an alpha 8.0.0 is updating
all the custom code on [http://plainblack.com](http://plainblack.com) and
[http://webgui.org](http://webgui.org). As always, plainblack.com and
webgui.org will be the first sites running the latest bleeding-edge version of
WebGUI (unless one of you wants to beat me to the punch).

This month, I also gave a presentation to [Madison.PM](http://madmongers.org)
about [building applications in WebGUI
8](http://preaction.github.com/WebGUI/8-apps.html), a quick introduction to
Assets and an overview of the most important changes to how they work. The
slides are available at
[http://preaction.github.com/](http://preaction.github.com/) and the code
samples are linked at the end.

On an unrelated topic, I really enjoyed using
[S5](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/) to build my slides,
[SHJS](http://shjs.sourceforge.net/) to highlight the code inside, and [Github
Pages](http://pages.github.com/) to host the whole thing. I plan on doing the
same for all my presentations: They look good, readable without a special
program, editable without a special program, anyone can fork and update my
presentations, and they're served by a nice, fast, free host.
