                <p><a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2014/04/03/brendan-eich-steps-down-as-mozilla-ceo/">What happened to Brendan Eich at Mozilla (resigning over community uproar for
his continued support of Prop
8)</a>
has now happened to one of Github's founders. <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2014/04/21/farewell-github-hello-immersive-computing.html">Tom Preston-Werner has resigned
due to community uproar over gender-based
harassment</a>.</p>

<p>Some are decrying this as an infringement on free speech. That people should be
do and say with impunity anything that is not illegal. That all people should
not criticize or judge anyone who is not doing something illegal, as though the
law is the only true measurement of good and evil.</p>

                <p>A long time ago, I used to blog about my feelings.</p>

<p>Obviously, since I’m a dude, I’m not supposed to have feelings. At least, I am
not supposed to have the feelings I confessed to having. At least, I am not
supposed to have those feelings if I am in sound mind.</p>
