            <p>A long time ago, I used to blog about my feelings.</p>

<p>Obviously, since I’m a dude, I’m not supposed to have feelings. At least, I am
not supposed to have the feelings I confessed to having. At least, I am not
supposed to have those feelings if I am in sound mind.</p>

<p>I still have those posts from Livejournal or from my personal sites. I don’t
look at them anymore, but they’re there if I ever want to retread the mental
pathways of memory.</p>

<p>A long time ago, I used to talk about my feelings.</p>

<p>The blog was the beginning, or the middle, or the end, but it was part of the
self-examination. The blog was just one way to explore and exhume and explain
and examine my feelings about my life thus far.</p>

<p>A long time ago, I used to care about my feelings.</p>

<p>They were bad feelings. They were narcissistic, self-centered, obtuse, and even
hurtful. I used them, or they used me, to inflict pain on other people. I do
not mention this to ask for forgiveness; I think I need the guilt. I mention
this informationally, casually, with that detached air I have carefully
cultivated.</p>

<p>I became afraid of feeling, over time. My anger had gotten the best of me a few
times, and my fists were raised, extended, retracted, lowered. My words, a more
elegant and effective weapon, were used more often.</p>

<p>Over time, the people went away, some driven and some drifted, but no new
people came to replace them. I’ve become withdrawn, sheltered. I don’t talk a
lot, and when I do I always say the wrong things.</p>

<p>I think it’s time to feel again.</p>

<p>I think it’s time to get over my fear of feelings.</p>
