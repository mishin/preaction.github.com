his continued support of Prop
8)</a>
has now happened to one of Github's founders. <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2014/04/21/farewell-github-hello-immersive-computing.html">Tom Preston-Werner has resigned
due to community uproar over gender-based
harassment</a>.</p>

<p>Some are decrying this as an infringement on free speech. That people should be

            <p>A long time ago, I used to blog about my feelings.</p>
