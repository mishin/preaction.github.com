title: Consuming Chaos

For what seems hours, you scan the board. The colors are sharp against the
simple background. Some movement catches your eye, but it doesn't feel right,
so you ignore it. Time stretches on.

There! The perfect move. Leaving the perfect next move. A quick flick. A match.
The pieces fall into place. Another match. Another. Another. A special piece.
Another special piece. It fires, triggering more. Chaos consumes.

The board is in ruins. Your carefully planned next move is lost in the
destruction. You're back to scanning the board to try to find where you belong
in this new world.

Is this a game, or is it your development strategy?

Software development is chaos. Either you work to managing chaos, consuming it,
or it works on consuming you. There are too many possibilities, too much input,
to brute-force your way to completion (how much software do you know of that
can be considered complete?).

In the face of these possibilities, a rigid development plan will fail. Vague
goals are better. Goals written in terms of a problem are best. Problems don't
change, once you find their roots.

I didn't know this post was going to be about Agile, but there it is.

Exact is for computers. We are not computers. We are human. We are chaos.
