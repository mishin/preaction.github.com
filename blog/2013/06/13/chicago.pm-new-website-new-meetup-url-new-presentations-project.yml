Lots of news for the Chicago.PM group! We've got a [new Chicago.PM
website](http://chicago.pm.org), powered by [Github](http://github.com), up at
[http://chicago.pm.org](http://chicago.pm.org). The website is completely
editable via Github using the [Octopress](http://octopress.org) system. We hope
to start sharing resources about Perl on our website, increasing the exposure
of the good tutorials and learning sites.

In addition to the new website, we've changed our Meetup URL, so [the
Chicago.PM Meetup group](http://meetup.com/ChicagoPM) is now at
[http://meetup.com/ChicagoPM](http://meetup.com/ChicagoPM).

Finally, with our new website, we're starting a project to help teach some
topics with more depth, to help fill in the gaps between the beginner's
materials and writing useful, maintainable code using the best CPAN has to
offer. We've started [the Chicago.PM Github
Organization](http://github.com/ChicagoPM), where we will be developing
presentations that can be used freely by anyone wishing to learn more about
Perl, or wanting to teach others about Perl. The presentations and the code
inside is licensed under the same terms as Perl itself, so if you can use Perl,
you can use and edit the presentations to suit your needs.

The first presentation we're releasing is about [building command-line
applications in Perl](https://github.com/ChicagoPM/Command-Line-Apps). I've
given this presentation twice now, to excellent reviews. There is still some
content that can be added to make it a more robust presentation (especially in
the [http://metacpan.org/release/App-Cmd](App::Cmd) section), but it's a good
talk on going from "Just read my first Perl book and my first Linux book" to
"Wielding Perl to build command-line applications."

We hope to build more presentations of this type in the future, as well as
other learning materials as time goes on. Let us know if you want to help!
