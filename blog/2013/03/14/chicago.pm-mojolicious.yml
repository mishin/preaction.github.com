February's meeting was about the [Mojolicious Web
Framework](http://mojolicio.us). [Joel
Berger](http://blogs.perl.org/users/joel_berger/) has written a [minimal Perl
CMS called Galileo](https://metacpan.org/module/Galileo), and agreed to give a
talk about the benefits of Mojolicious.

Best of all, [the talk itself was written in
Mojolicious](https://github.com/jberger/MojoliciousIntroduction)! As Joel was
talking, he was able to edit the code and display the results, showing off
various features of Mojolicious like:

* Websockets
* Easy testing (even of websockets)
* Helper scripts
* Mojo templates

There are quite a few interesting parts of Mojolicious that make it worth
giving a look to, and I hope to be able to do so with some web projects that
have been sitting in my queue for a while (I wrote a nice ticket tracker with
AngularJS, but the backend is Python, I'd like to fix that glaring mistake).
