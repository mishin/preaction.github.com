                <h2>Auth changes</h2>

<p>WebGUI::Auth was developed as part of 6.0.0, back in 2003. To put that into
perspective:</p>

<ul>
<li>Auth predates Facebook, which was founded in 2004.</li>
<li>Since Auth, there have been two Summer Olympiads.</li>
<li>Auth was written when I was still in college.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since then, it has not fundamentally changed, though everything about the
Internet surely has.</p>

<hr />

<p>We began our planning for 8.0 with the idea to completely rebuild Auth from
scratch, but that quickly got scrapped when we realized both the scope of that
project. But since Auth is one of the most visible parts of a WebGUI site for
the end-user, who must be able to quickly and simply create an account and log
in to participate in the community of your website, we decided to take a closer
look at what we could do to improve the Auth API.</p>

<p>What resulted were a series of small changes (and only one break) that has made
it far easier to create convenient choices for your users.</p>

<h2>Multiple Methods</h2>

<p>One of the largest changes in how the Internet works since Auth was created was
the propagation of Single-Sign-On systems like OpenID and OAuth. Now, instead
of requiring a username and password for every site you visit, websites will
allow you to sign in with your existing Facebook, Twitter, or Google ID. This
makes it easier for users to interact with your site, which improves the return
rate.</p>

<p>Historically, a WebGUI user would have only one way to login. If they had a
username/password, they could only use that. If they were an LDAP user, they
could only use that. Worse, only one Auth plugin could be chosen as "default",
which means that new users could only create themselves with that single
plugin.</p>

<p>In 7.9, we added the ability for new users to choose what they use to create
their account and login. Now, by passing in the name of the auth plugin, we can
offer users multiple ways to join our site. As a test, we added a Twitter-based
auth plugin based on the Net::Twitter module, and a Facebook auth plugin based
on Facebook::Graph.</p>

<p>![](/blog/images/whats-new-in-webgui-8.0-2-auth-improvements/Screen shot 2011-01-21 at 2.02.13 PM.png)</p>

<p>Fig 1,294: A WebGUI site with username/password and Facebook login</p>

<p>In addition, once the user has logged-in via Facebook or Twitter, they have the
ability to set a password. In the extremely unlikely case that Facebook or
Twitter goes down, they can still get into your site with their WebGUI
password.</p>

<h2>API cleanup</h2>

<p>As one of the few features of WebGUI that predates the Asset system (our
application plugins), the Auth API stuck out from our future API direction. In
order to instantiate an Auth object, you had to call the superclass constructor
and rebless the object. In order to call an Auth method from the web, you had
to mark it using setCallable(). In order to update the user information for the
Auth method, you had to call saveParams() and pass in the name of the auth
method and the user to work with (which were both known by the object anyway).</p>

<pre><code># old-style Auth plugin for Twitter
package WebGUI::Auth::Twitter;

sub new {
    my ( $class, $session, $name, $userId ) = @_;
    my $self = $class-&gt;SUPER::new( $session, $name, $userId );
    $self-&gt;setCallable( [ qw( createAccount createAccountSave displayLogin login ... ) ] );
    return bless $self, $class;
}

sub createAccountSave {
    my ( $self ) = @_;
    my %formData = ();
    # ... validate data coming in, and then...
    $self-&gt;saveParams( $self-&gt;user, $self-&gt;authMethod, \%formData );
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, we've massaged the Auth API to look like our other APIs. The constructor
was fixed to not require re-blessing. Instead of setCallable(), we use www_
methods to mark which methods can be called from the web. This sets those
methods apart from non-web methods, and removes the need to explicitly say
which methods are web methods. Finally, saveParams() was changed to update()
and works the same as the other updates: Take a hash or hashref, put it in the
database table.</p>

<pre><code># new-style Auth plugin for Twitter
package WebGUI::Auth::Twitter;

# Don't need to override constructor anymore! 
# no re-bless. no setCallable. authMethod name is determined automatically

sub www_createAccountSave {
    my ( $self ) = @_;
    my %formData = ();
    # ... validate data coming in, and then...
    $self-&gt;update( %formData );
}
</code></pre>

<p>The most important part of this is that now if you understand the update() and
www_ methods from the Asset system, the Form system, the Workflow system, the
Operation system, and the Shop system, you understand the update() and www_
methods from the Auth system. When there are many valid ways of doing
something, it doesn't matter which one you pick, as long as you are consistent
in that choice throughout the project.</p>

<p>The only downside to the new Auth API is the one backwards incompatible change:
The method signature of the new() method has changed, there is no authMethod
name passed in. Luckily for most people, the migration is easy: Delete your
new() method, and rename your web-callable subs to start with www_ and it will
just work.</p>

<h2>Future Plans</h2>

<p>Through our massage of the Auth API, we've gotten new ideas on how Auth plugins
should work. In the future, users will be able to configure as many auth
methods as they want. Those choices will all be available from a single account
screen. With FormBuilder (discussed later), we can make it even easier to
create full-featured Auth methods. An auth method can inherit a form, add a few
fields, and present that new form to the user.</p>

<p>To increase flexibility, we're going to refactor the Auth API to be more easily
extensible. The default Auth methods can be used as stepping-stones to more
specific auth methods, decreasing the development time for your site, and
making a more stable platform for your organization.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for next time where I'll go over our brand-new upgrade system.</p>

                <h2>Overview</h2>

<p>On September 9, 2009, WebGUI 8 was announced. Since it was the first major API
change since WebGUI 7, we started planning WebGUI 8 with high expectations.
Over the course of the last 16 months:</p>

<ul>
<li>We've adopted PSGI/Plack as our platform, enabling us to work in any HTTP
environment.</li>
<li>We've made massive changes to the Asset system to make them easier to build.</li>
<li>We've reworked Auth to make it easier to add Twitter and Facebook
authentication for your users.</li>
<li>We've rebuilt the upgrade system to be easier for developers and system
administrators.</li>
<li>There is a new caching system enabling memcached and local memory caches.</li>
<li>The entire content management interface was rebuilt from scratch with the
latest buzzword-worthy technologies.</li>
<li>Assets are now based on Moose, the new object-oriented system for Perl.</li>
<li>We've created WebGUI::FormBuilder, a way to make introspect-able forms.</li>
<li>We're migrating to InnoDB to take advantage of transactions and foreign key
constraints.</li>
<li>We're making a brand-new WRE based on Nginx, and Server::Starter for more
efficient resource usage and no-downtime restarts.</li>
</ul>

<p>And these are just the major features. We've cleaned up and straightened out a
lot of the crooked parts of programming in WebGUI, and we have plans to do even
more. We've greatly improved the flexibility of WebGUI without compromising any
more backward compatibility.</p>

<h2>Ambition is the first step</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, our ambitious goals have taken longer than we thought. We had
promised a WebGUI 8.0 Beta in January, and I have to say that isn't possible.
The way things look right now, WebGUI 8.0 will be ready this summer.</p>

<p>So, as atonement and apology, I offer this series of bi-weekly blog posts about
all the new stuff in WebGUI 8.</p>

<h2>PSGI / Plack</h2>

<p>The most exciting change in WebGUI 8 is the move to PSGI using Plack. WebGUI is
no longer just an Apache/mod_perl application, though it can certainly still
run under Apache/mod_perl. Now, WebGUI can also run under Starman, a
high-performance web server specifically for PSGI applications. WebGUI can run
inside POE. WebGUI can once again run as CGI. We are no longer tied to one way
of deploying WebGUI, and that greater flexibility will allow for better
performance for your specific need.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env perl
# webgui.cgi - Run WebGUI as a CGI application
use lib 'lib';
use Plack::Loader;
use Plack::Handler::CGI;
$ENV{WEBGUI_CONFIG} = "www.example.com.conf";
my $app = Plack::Util::load_psgi("share/site.psgi");
Plack::Handler::CGI-&gt;new-&gt;run($app);
</code></pre>

<p>Since WebGUI is just a PSGI application, it can also run alongside any other
PSGI applications. WebGUI and Catalyst can work together on the same site.</p>

<p>For example, here's WebGUI and Pod::Browser running together. Pod::Browser
takes /doc and serves the WebGUI POD, every other request goes to WebGUI.</p>

<pre><code># pod.psgi
use lib 'lib';
use Plack::Builder;
use Plack::Util;

BEGIN {
    $ENV{POD_BROWSER_CONFIG} = "pod_browser.json";
}
use Pod::Browser;
use Catalyst::Engine::PSGI;
Pod::Browser-&gt;setup_engine('PSGI');

$ENV{WEBGUI_CONFIG} = "core.conf";
use WebGUI;

builder {
    mount "/doc" =&gt; sub { Pod::Browser-&gt;run(@_); };
    mount "/" =&gt; Plack::Util::load_psgi("share/site.psgi");
};

# pod_browser.json
{
    "Controller::Root" : {
        "self" : 1,
        "inc" : 1,
        "namespaces" : [ "WebGUI*" ]
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>For developers, Plack opens up new ways of building WebGUI sites. Instead of
WebGUI::URL handlers, now we use Plack middleware to handle such tasks as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Opening the WebGUI::Session</li>
<li>Handling /extras and /uploads</li>
<li>Showing the maintenance page, if necessary</li>
<li>Handling the wgaccess files for uploads permissions</li>
<li>Showing debugging information and performance indicators</li>
</ul>

<p>By using more flexible tools, we can write more reusable code. You can write a
Plack middleware for WebGUI that will work in your other Plack applications,
and WebGUI can take advantage of the middleware out there on CPAN. </p>

<p>Plack middleware currently only replaces URL handlers, but someday we can
replace WebGUI::Content handlers as well. WebGUI's pieces can be mixed and
matched to create your own applications without using parts of WebGUI that you
don't need.</p>

<p>By switching to PSGI/Plack, we've made WebGUI easier to deploy and easier to
develop.</p>

<p>Next time, I'll talk about the improvements to the WebGUI Auth API.</p>
