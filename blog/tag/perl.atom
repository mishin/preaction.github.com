            <p>I ran into a frustrating problem the other day:</p>

<pre><code>$ git add -i
/usr/bin/perl: symbol lookup error: ~/perl5/lib/perl5/x86_64-linux-thread-multi/auto/List/Util/Util.so:
undefined symbol: Perl_xs_apiversion_bootcheck
fatal: 'add--interactive' appears to be a git command, but we were not
able to execute it. Maybe git-add--interactive is broken?
</code></pre>

<p>I've seen this error message from Perl a lot. It basically means that I'm
trying to load an XS module compiled for a different version of Perl. Since
<code>git</code> is directly trying to run <code>/usr/bin/perl</code> (5.10.1) as opposed to the
<code>perlbrew</code> Perl I have installed (5.16.3), the error comes as no surprise:
<code>PERL5LIB</code> is checked before Perl's built-in libraries. So if you have a
<code>local::lib</code> (which adds its directories to <code>PERL5LIB</code>) and try to use those
modules in a different Perl, things may not work as you expected.</p>

<p>What is more surprising is that Git explicitly uses <code>/usr/bin/perl</code> in the
first place. Some Google-fu brought up a <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/147462">thread on the Git mailing list about
changing to <code>#!/usr/bin/env
perl</code></a>, but it
appears this was rejected. According to another post in that thread, <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/147475">it is
possible to set PERL_PATH when running <code>make</code> on
Git</a>, but that
did not seem to work for me.</p>

<p>But the Git Perl scripts all seem to have one thing in common: They all add the
paths in the <code>GITPERLLIB</code> environment variable to the front of <code>@INC</code> as
the first thing they do. <code>GITPERLLIB</code> is treated as a <code>:</code>-delimited list of
directories, like <code>PERL5LIB</code>. So if we fill in <code>GITPERLLIB</code> with the right
directories, we can ensure that the right <code>List::Util</code> version is found
first.</p>

<p>The right directories are part of Perl's <code>Config</code>. This configuration is
available to us in Perl scripts through the <code>Config</code> module which provides a
<code>%Config</code> hash.  There are three "layers" of Perl library paths, "core",
"vendor", and "site", configured in the following Config keys:</p>

<ul>
<li>core    => 'archlib', 'privlib'</li>
<li>vendor  => 'vendorarch', 'vendorlib'</li>
<li>site    => 'sitearch', 'sitelib'</li>
</ul>

<p>The "core" libraries are just that, the core Perl 5 libraries. The "vendor"
libraries are additional libraries that your vendor may have provided in their
Perl distribution. The "site" libraries are the CPAN libraries you've
downloaded and installed via the <code>cpan</code> client (unless you're using local::lib,
which overrides the install directories).</p>

<p>Armed with these Config keys, we can make a <code>GITPERLLIB</code> that overrides our local::lib
directories. So now, in my <code>.zshrc</code>, I have:</p>

<pre><code># Fix git perl scripts in case of local::lib
# If we install modules for a different arch in local::lib, we'll get some problems
if [[ -x /usr/bin/perl ]]; then
    export GITPERLLIB=`/usr/bin/perl -MConfig -e'print join ":", grep { $_ } map { $Config{$_} } qw( sitearch sitelib vendorarch vendorlib archlib privlib )'`
fi
</code></pre>

<p>Now I can do my proper <code>git add --interactive</code> again!</p>

            <p>... or "Ask Not To Whom The Pointer Points, It Points To Thee."</p>

<p>TL;DR: A pointer is not a reference. A pointer knows nothing about the data
being pointed to. Returning multiple values requires actual work.</p>

<p>Everything went wrong when I wanted a string with a <code>NUL</code> character inside it.
C strings are not Perl scalars, they don't know how long they are. So to mark
the end of a string, C uses the <code>NUL</code> character, <code>\0</code>. The <code>strcpy</code> function will
copy to your destination until the first <code>\0</code> from your source. When you want to
have a string with a <code>\0</code> inside of it that does not mark the end of the string,
you need to know exactly how long the string is. This is not difficult to do,
but you also have to return that length from the function that creates your
string.</p>

<p>C functions do not have more than one return value.</p>

<pre><code>(char* buffer, int bufferSize) = get_string_with_nuls();
// You thought it could be that easy?
</code></pre>

<p>So in order for your function to result in more than one value, you have to
pass in references to be used to fill in with actual values.</p>

<pre><code>char* buffer;
int bufferSize = get_string_with_nuls( buffer );
// C programmers will already know what I did wrong here
</code></pre>

<p>Thinking like a Perl programmer, I thought I could just pass in the pointer to
the function and the function could fill it with data. Two problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>I passed in the pointer itself, not a reference to the pointer: <code>&amp;buffer</code></li>
<li>I did not initialize the pointer to anything.</li>
</ol>

<p>A more correct way would be:</p>

<pre><code>char* buffer = malloc( 128 * sizeof( char ) );
int bufferSize = get_string_with_nuls( &amp;buffer );
</code></pre>

<p>But this suffers from another problem: I have to know beforehand how big my
string is going to be and allocate that much memory beforehand.</p>

<p>The way I ended up succeeding was:</p>

<pre><code>int bufferSize;
char* buffer = get_string_with_nuls( &amp;bufferSize );
</code></pre>

<p>This way, <code>get_string_with_nuls</code> can handle the <code>malloc</code> with exactly the correct
size and give it to me. I don't have to guess at a size beforehand.</p>

<p>Of course, a struct could do this better, or since I'm actually in C++, an
object. I'll be planning a new API as soon as I confirm this one actually
works and has proper tests (written in Perl, of course).</p>
