This month's project night focused on Joel Berger's Alien::Base module. The
final bugs are either squashed or very close, and we got an introduction to how
the whole thing works.

I learned some interesting things about DynaLoader that helped cement the idea
that it's an interface on to the system's dynamic linker. I've never dealt with
DynaLoader from the Perl side of things, except when it broke, and I would
solve those problems in system-specific ways. I learned that DynaLoader could
solve those problems in a cross-platform way.

I started writing my own Alien::Base module for libusb, but unfortunately ran
out of time. We had some interesting side-discussion on human interface devices
and augmented reality.

In two weeks, I'll be [giving a talk on scripting Git with
Perl](http://www.meetup.com/Windy-City-Perl-mongers-Meetup/events/85508372/).
Come on down and check it out!
