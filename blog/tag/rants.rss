                <p>At the Bank we have a home-grown ETL framework that we've been using for quite
some time. We recently completed a total rewrite, but unfortunately we left out
a few changes. Had I gotten those changes in 5 months ago, I would have only
had to break the API of about 10 modules. Today, in order to make those
changes, I have to break the API of 122 modules.</p>

<p>What follows is an account of this ordeal, provided for entertainment value
only. There will be a future post that explains some of the things I did to
make this task surmountable.</p>
