                <p>I got a text at 8:00am:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Hey, can you jump on a conference call?"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Groggy and disoriented, I blearily type the conference line and enter my
passcode, followed by the pound or hash sign. At the tone, I would be the 6th
person to enter the conference. Tone.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The app is down, and trading has stopped."</p>
</blockquote>

                <p><a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/preaction/2015/01/managing-sql-data-with-yertl.html">Originally posted on blogs.perl.org -- Managing SQL Data with
Yertl</a></p>

<p>Every week, I work with about a dozen SQL databases. Some are Sybase, some
MySQL, some SQLite. Some have different versions in dev, staging, and
production. All of them need data extracted, transformed, and loaded.</p>

<p>DBI is the clear choice for dealing with SQL databases in Perl, but there are a
dozen lines of Perl code in between me and the operation that I want. Sure,
I've got modules and web applications and ad-hoc commands and scripts that
perform certain individual tasks on my databases, but sometimes those things
don't quite do what I need right now, and I just want something that will let
me execute whatever SQL I can come up with.</p>

<p><a href="http://metacpan.org/pod/ETL::Yertl">Yertl (ETL::Yertl)</a> is a shell-based ETL
framework. It's under development (as is all software), but included already is
a small utility called <a href="http://metacpan.org/pod/ysql">ysql</a> to make dealing
with SQL databases easy.</p>

                <p>The past me is another person. Sometimes antagonist, sometimes friend, past me
(postaction?) had ideas, hopes, and dreams and developed some of them into
software that I and others use. Unfortunately, that asshole left bugs all
through the code for me to fix.</p>

<p>I can't blame him. Nobody's perfect, not even idealized/demonized copies of my
past self. But I do have to fix them, and deal with the messes he left.</p>

<p>Lucky for me, while he was writing buggy software, he left extensive notes for
me to use...</p>

            <title>Manage Boilerplate with Import::Base</title>

                <p>Boilerplate is everything I hate about programming:</p>

<ul>
<li>Doing the same thing more than once</li>
<li>Leaving clutter in every file</li>
<li>Making it harder to change things in the future</li>
<li>Eventually blindly copying without understanding (cargo-cult programming)</li>
</ul>

<p>In an effort to reduce some of my boilerplate, I wrote
<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Import::Base">Import::Base</a>, a module to collect and
import useful bundles of modules, removing the need for long lists of <code>use ...</code>
lines everywhere.</p>

                <p><img src="/images/blog/ive-made-a-huge-mistake.gif" alt="I've made a huge mistake" /></p>

<p>A long time ago, when I started building my first video game server for
<a href="http://doublecluepon.com">Double Cluepon</a>, my video game company, I did a bad
thing. I looked at the AMF library for Perl and Python and decided that
Python's looked better. I had always meant to learn Python, and this felt like
the perfect opportunity. It had cooperative multitasking (Twisted) and it had
an ORM (SQLAlchemy), so along with the messaging format (PyAMF), I had
everything I needed to build a server for a Flash MMO (later migrated to AIR).</p>

<p>Let me reiterate my mistake: While under time constraints, I chose to learn a
new programming language. I didn't realize my mistake until it was too late.</p>
