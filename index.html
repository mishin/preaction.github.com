                <p>I ran into a frustrating problem the other day:</p>

<pre><code>$ git add -i
/usr/bin/perl: symbol lookup error: ~/perl5/lib/perl5/x86_64-linux-thread-multi/auto/List/Util/Util.so:
undefined symbol: Perl_xs_apiversion_bootcheck
fatal: 'add--interactive' appears to be a git command, but we were not
able to execute it. Maybe git-add--interactive is broken?
</code></pre>

<p>I've seen this error message from Perl a lot. It basically means that I'm
trying to load an XS module compiled for a different version of Perl. Since
<code>git</code> is directly trying to run <code>/usr/bin/perl</code> (5.10.1) as opposed to the
<code>perlbrew</code> Perl I have installed (5.16.3), the error comes as no surprise:
<code>PERL5LIB</code> is checked before Perl's built-in libraries. So if you have a
<code>local::lib</code> (which adds its directories to <code>PERL5LIB</code>) and try to use those
modules in a different Perl, things may not work as you expected.</p>

<p>What is more surprising is that Git explicitly uses <code>/usr/bin/perl</code> in the
first place. Some Google-fu brought up a <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/147462">thread on the Git mailing list about
changing to <code>#!/usr/bin/env
perl</code></a>, but it
appears this was rejected. According to another post in that thread, <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/147475">it is
possible to set PERL_PATH when running <code>make</code> on
Git</a>, but that
did not seem to work for me.</p>

<p>But the Git Perl scripts all seem to have one thing in common: They all add the
paths in the <code>GITPERLLIB</code> environment variable to the front of <code>@INC</code> as
the first thing they do. <code>GITPERLLIB</code> is treated as a <code>:</code>-delimited list of
directories, like <code>PERL5LIB</code>. So if we fill in <code>GITPERLLIB</code> with the right
directories, we can ensure that the right <code>List::Util</code> version is found
first.</p>

<p>The right directories are part of Perl's <code>Config</code>. This configuration is
available to us in Perl scripts through the <code>Config</code> module which provides a
<code>%Config</code> hash.  There are three "layers" of Perl library paths, "core",
"vendor", and "site", configured in the following Config keys:</p>

<ul>
<li>core    => 'archlib', 'privlib'</li>
<li>vendor  => 'vendorarch', 'vendorlib'</li>
<li>site    => 'sitearch', 'sitelib'</li>
</ul>

<p>The "core" libraries are just that, the core Perl 5 libraries. The "vendor"
libraries are additional libraries that your vendor may have provided in their
Perl distribution. The "site" libraries are the CPAN libraries you've
downloaded and installed via the <code>cpan</code> client (unless you're using local::lib,
which overrides the install directories).</p>

<p>Armed with these Config keys, we can make a <code>GITPERLLIB</code> that overrides our local::lib
directories. So now, in my <code>.zshrc</code>, I have:</p>

<pre><code># Fix git perl scripts in case of local::lib
# If we install modules for a different arch in local::lib, we'll get some problems
if [[ -x /usr/bin/perl ]]; then
    export GITPERLLIB=`/usr/bin/perl -MConfig -e'print join ":", grep { $_ } map { $Config{$_} } qw( sitearch sitelib vendorarch vendorlib archlib privlib )'`
fi
</code></pre>

<p>Now I can do my proper <code>git add --interactive</code> again!</p>

                <p>Lots of news for the Chicago.PM group! We've got a <a href="http://chicago.pm.org">new Chicago.PM
website</a>, powered by <a href="http://github.com">Github</a>, up at
<a href="http://chicago.pm.org">http://chicago.pm.org</a>. The website is completely
editable via Github using the <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> system. We hope
to start sharing resources about Perl on our website, increasing the exposure
of the good tutorials and learning sites.</p>

<hr />

<p>In addition to the new website, we've changed our Meetup URL, so <a href="http://meetup.com/ChicagoPM">the
Chicago.PM Meetup group</a> is now at
<a href="http://meetup.com/ChicagoPM">http://meetup.com/ChicagoPM</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, with our new website, we're starting a project to help teach some
topics with more depth, to help fill in the gaps between the beginner's
materials and writing useful, maintainable code using the best CPAN has to
offer. We've started <a href="http://github.com/ChicagoPM">the Chicago.PM Github
Organization</a>, where we will be developing
presentations that can be used freely by anyone wishing to learn more about
Perl, or wanting to teach others about Perl. The presentations and the code
inside is licensed under the same terms as Perl itself, so if you can use Perl,
you can use and edit the presentations to suit your needs.</p>

<p>The first presentation we're releasing is about <a href="https://github.com/ChicagoPM/Command-Line-Apps">building command-line
applications in Perl</a>. I've
given this presentation twice now, to excellent reviews. There is still some
content that can be added to make it a more robust presentation (especially in
the <a href="App::Cmd">http://metacpan.org/release/App-Cmd</a> section), but it's a good
talk on going from "Just read my first Perl book and my first Linux book" to
"Wielding Perl to build command-line applications."</p>

<p>We hope to build more presentations of this type in the future, as well as
other learning materials as time goes on. Let us know if you want to help!</p>

                <p>Last week, <a href="http://petdance.com">Andy Lester</a> (author of <a href="http://petdance.com/book/">Land the Tech Job You
Love</a>) came to talk about tools to help programmers
work more efficiently and the 2.0 release of his <a href="http://beyondgrep.com">Ack search
tool</a>.</p>

<hr />

<p>If you haven't tried Ack, but you use long, complicated Grep lines every day,
you're missing out on a great, time-saving tool. <a href="http://beyondgrep.com/install">Installing
ack</a> is easy on many platforms (including
Windows!).</p>

<p>For those who have added Ack to their regular arsenal, the 2.0 release brings
some minor breaking changes (removing the -a option for "search all files" and
changing the default file type filter to "all text files") designed to make Ack
more Do-What-I-Mean and more compatible with Grep (when it makes sense, ack is
made for humans). The result being that using Ack should not take you out of
The Zone by requiring you to check the manual every time (something I must
confess to doing often with Grep and Find).</p>

<p>I must also confess to using only the most basic Ack command-line options, but
Andy explored a lot of functionality I was not aware of, both in Ack and Grep:</p>

<pre><code># Search for full words
ack -w
grep -w

# List the files that matched instead of the matching line
ack -l
grep -l

# Invert the match ("does not match X")
ack -v
grep -v

# Override the default output with capture groups
ack 'use (\S+);' --output='$1' -h | sort -u

# Search the file path for matches (Beyond Find)
ack -f
ack -g

# Accept a list of files to search on STDIN (Built-in Xargs)
ack -x
</code></pre>

<p>The last two features are great for chaining together Ack commands:</p>

<pre><code># Find all perl files not in the 'release' repository
ack -g -v 'release' --perl |

# ... search them for the word '2.46.3207.2'
ack -x '2.46.3207.2' -w -l | 

# ... and if they match, edit them with sed
xargs sed -i 's/2.46.3207.2/2.49.3333.12/'

# This little snippet saved me some hours of manual work upgrading version numbers
</code></pre>

<p>There was also a lot of discussion on other tools to help programmers be more
efficient. The ones I was most interested in were ctags, which I don't use
nearly enough (I use ack instead), and cscope, which I had never heard about. </p>

<p>The problem with adding new things to your toolkit is integrating them into
your flow (the flow that can be consciously experienced is not the true flow).
Whenever you add a new thing, especially if it replaces an existing thing,
you're losing efficiency in the short-term in order to add potential efficiency
in the long-term. Despite this, a lot of things are worth it, Ack more-so than
most. </p>

<p>Sometimes you don't know you're doing something inefficiently until someone
comes along and tells you so, or shows you a solution to a problem you never
knew you were having. Ack is a solution to a grep problem: Grep is harder to
use in the most-common cases. That said, Grep still has its uses, just uncommon
ones.</p>

<p>A big thanks to Andy for giving a presentation on such short notice! Our next
meeting is on May 23, so check out <a href="http://chicago.pm.org">the Chicago.pm
website</a> and join us!</p>

                <p>A co-worker came to me today with a curious error message:</p>

<pre><code>use DateTime;
my $date = DateTime-&gt;new( year =&gt; 2013, month =&gt; 4, day =&gt; 15 );
$date-&gt;set_time_zone("Australia/Sydney");
print $date-&gt;today;'
</code></pre>

<p>This code gives the error <code>Can't locate object method "_normalize_nanoseconds"
via package "2013-04-15T00:00:00" at
/usr2/local/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.16.3/lib/site_perl/5.16.3/x86_64-linux-thread-multi/DateTime.pm
line 252.</code></p>

<p>The package "2013-04-15T00:00:00" is the curious part: It looks like a
stringified DateTime, but who could possibly be stringifying a DateTime object
and then using that as a package name?</p>

<hr />

<p>It turns out the problem is at <code>$date-&gt;today</code>. <code>today()</code> is a constructor,
constructors are class methods, constructors inevitably call <code>bless</code> on the
class they are invoked with. But, we called this constructor with an object
instance (a blessed reference), not a class.</p>

<p>In an object without overloads, this fails (as expected) with an error message:
<code>Attempt to bless into a reference</code>. But DateTime overloads stringification. So
instead of trying to use an object as a package name, the object gets
stringified and that string gets used as a package name.</p>

<p>This problem could be mitigated by checking for refs in the constructor, dying
as a result. I'm not sure if it would be a good idea to disallow
stringification during a call to <code>bless</code>, for historical reasons (it's not a
bug if it's working as expected, it is a bug if a change breaks code).</p>

<p>Here's some sample code to play around with the problem. Enable/disable the
overload (comment out the <code>use overload (...)</code>) and see what changes:</p>

<pre><code>use strict;
use warnings;

package Foo;

use overload (
    q{""} =&gt; sub { return "Bar" },
);

sub new {
    my ( $class ) = @_;
    return bless {}, $class;
}

sub greet {
    print "Hello, World!\n";
}

package main;

my $obj = Foo-&gt;new;
$obj-&gt;greet;

my $clone = $obj-&gt;new;
$clone-&gt;greet;
</code></pre>

                <p>At the Bank we have a home-grown ETL framework that we've been using for quite
some time. We recently completed a total rewrite, but unfortunately we left out
a few changes. Had I gotten those changes in 5 months ago, I would have only
had to break the API of about 10 modules. Today, in order to make those
changes, I have to break the API of 122 modules.</p>

<p>What follows is an account of this ordeal, provided for entertainment value
only. There will be a future post that explains some of the things I did to
make this task surmountable.</p>

<li>4:31pm - 112 modules left - And then I remember there's another feature to
add that will require another migration of all these modules I will have to do.</li>
<li>4:52pm - 106 modules left -
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Test::Continuous">Test::Continuous</a> removes 3
steps for each module. Total time saved: HOLY FUCK THAT'S AWESOME</li>
<li>5:35pm - 97 modules left - Every commit message during this ordeal is another
love note to those who put off this migration five months ago, when there were
only 10 modules to migrate.</li>
<li>6:09pm - 94 modules left - New API to change: Create a role to do it for me!
+100 experience points!</li>
<li>6:15pm - 93 modules left - Why unpack the hash of args passed-in to the
method if the method you're calling takes exactly the same arguments? <code>my
$arg_name = $args{arg_name}; return $self-&gt;method( arg_name =&gt; $arg_name )</code>
should never happen!</li>
<li>6:37pm - 87 modules left - A thought: If the other team using this project
ultimately rejects this API change, I get to write my own brand-new ETL
framework from scratch! Temptation, thy name is Zoidberg.</li>
<li>6:51pm - 84 modules left - Found a bug in the new API! Finally something
interesting to do!</li>
<li>7:00pm - 80 modules left - Every time you copy/paste code in tests, God
inflicts another programmer with carpal tunnel. Please think of the
programmers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Day 2</h2>

<ul>
<li>3:02pm - 80 modules left - Let's see if I remember all the macros I left in
vim over the weekend... Test::Continuous is still running, which is nice</li>
<li>3:18pm - 71 modules left - The end is in sight!</li>
<li>4:30pm - 52 modules left - Perhaps I was premature...</li>
<li>6:30pm - 41 modules left - Caught up putting out fires in other places.
Derail.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Day 3</h2>

<ul>
<li>1:35pm - 41 modules left - Another bug in the new API. Doing it this way is
certainly shaking out the bugs.</li>
<li>2:21pm - 20 modules left - Smooth sailing at last...</li>
<li>3:47pm - 0 modules left - AND THE CROWD GOES WILD!</li>
</ul>

<p>Total time elapsed: 3.25+3.5+2.25 = 9 hours. Not bad for 130 commits to migrate
122 modules.</p>
